#### Lessons Learned:

While trying to deploy to Heroku, I encountered the following error:

![Heroku Error](https://imagebucketgaackproject.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Imagefolder/Screen+Shot+2021-03-17+at+11.26.34+PM.png)

After researching, it was discovered that it was not an uncommon issue and is related to an issue where node_modules are being pushed to the heroku environment.  This issue was resolved by following the instructions listed in the "Don't check in generated directories" section of the Heroku troubleshooting documentation [troubleshooting documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/troubleshooting-node-deploys#don-t-check-in-generated-directories)
